          So, I have to introduce myself I think. I'm a first year student in ESSEC, I love all kinds of sports and I myself practice a lot. At least that's what i did before, I have had a wrist injury for more than 6 months already and i can't play anymore... But well, I do my best to try to do other things as being focused in class and laugh with my friends ! I will now give you a link to one of my most favorite website : Youtube ! You obviously know it already but that's my profile so I will still put it here !

        <h2>Mangas</h2>
        <p>
          Since my childhood, I have developped a huge love for mangas. It has always been a way for me to escape and travel through different worlds as well as a way to reflect upon myself and the world around me.

        <h2>Army</h2>
        <p>
          Although I did not become a soldier or I did not enrolled in a military school, I did spent 3 years of my life in a military high school were it was almost as if we were young soldiers. I was really one of the best experiences that I had the luck  to experience !
